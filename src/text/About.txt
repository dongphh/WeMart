Our technologies are aimed towards allowing user interaction in a very streamlined, e-commerce atmosphere. In a world that is more interested in upselling the customer before the point-of-sale, we desired to create a user experience that removes the clutter and allows the most direct means of commerce between our users and our store. As a result, we created WeMart, which allows users to seamlessly browse through quality grocery items for an optimal shopping experience online.
